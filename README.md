# Easy Chef - Phase 1
This repository represents the first phase of the term project developed during my web development course. The ultimate objective of the course was to create a fully functional recipe website called "Easy Chef." Our team, consisting of three members, collaborated to complete this project.

## Project Overview
In this initial phase, our task was to create a static demo of the Easy Chef website using HTML and CSS. It's important to note that this phase does not involve the implementation of frontend/backend servers or JavaScript logic. Nevertheless, the static demo includes several noteworthy features:

**Responsive Design**: The website is designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes thanks to a collapsible navigation bar and Bootstrap's grid layout feature.

**Navigation**: Users can easily navigate the website, which includes multiple pages and a user-friendly navigation bar.

**Recipe Cards**: Each recipe in a list is presented as a clickable card, providing a convenient way to access detailed recipe information.

**Homepage Carousels**: The homepage showcases various carousels that categorize recipes, making it easy for users to explore recipes by meal type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner).

**All Recipes Page**: This page offers a dynamic experience with toggleable tabs, allowing users to switch between viewing the most popular recipes and a comprehensive list of recipes without being redirected.

Please note that this phase focuses on the static representation of the website's design and layout.

## Project Phases
